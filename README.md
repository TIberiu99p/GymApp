GYM APP made in C++

IT HAS THE FOLLOWING FUNCTIONALITIES SO FAR: 

    Tracks your personal records (PRs) for each lift: squat, bench and deadlift.
 
    Logs for you to record your workouts and track your progress. 
 
    Offers tips and exercises to help you improve your form and lift more weight.
 
    Calculates your one-rep max (1RM) based on the weights and reps you've lifted.
 
    Provide a personalized workout plan to help you reach your goals(still needs some work).
 
    Has a command-line interface.

TO BE ADDED IN THE FUTURE:

    Add a feature that allows the user to view the personal records for a specific lift, along with the form tips and assistance exercises for that lift. This could be done by adding a new command to the command-line interface and implementing a new member function in the RecordsTracker class.

    Add a feature that allows the user to filter the workout log by lift name, date, or weight lifted. This could be done by adding a new command to the command-line interface and implementing a new member function in the RecordsTracker class.

    Add a feature that allows the user to view their progress over time by plotting their personal records on a graph. This could be done by using a library like matplotlib to generate the graph.

    Add a feature that allows the user to set goals for each lift and track their progress towards those goals. This could be done by adding a new field to the Lift struct to store the goal weight and implementing a new member function in the RecordsTracker class that returns the percentage of the goal that has been achieved.

    Add a feature that suggests new personal records for the user based on their previous performances. This could be done by analyzing the user's workout log and using a formula to estimate their potential one-rep max for each lift.
